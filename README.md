# EQPAddNozzleNumber
Select parametric equipment in Plant 3D and get the nozzle number as MText attached into the port of each nozzle. This MText labels will be attached to the equipment. Purpose is to find quickly the nozzle number e.g. in Navisworks.
Block based equipment does not work as a selection, here you should model the labels in the block yourself.
